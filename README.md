# 2 Music 2 Furious

A native iOS app for people who want to listen to two things at once.

---

## The Problem

You're at the gym. You want music to keep you moving, but you also want to catch up on a podcast or audiobook. Every app makes you choose one or the other.

**2 Music 2 Furious** lets you play both simultaneously with independent volume controls — so you can have your favorite playlist at 70% while a podcast plays at 40%, adjusted exactly how you like it.

## What It Does

The app provides two independent audio players:

**Music Player** — For background audio you don't need to focus on
- Your iPhone's Music Library
- Internet radio streams

**Speech Player** — For content you want to follow
- Podcasts (search, subscribe, download)
- Audiobooks (LibriVox free audiobooks + imported M4B files)
- Articles and documents (with text-to-speech)

Both players work together: shared lock screen controls, proper AirPods support, and background playback that actually works.

## Status

🚧 **In Development** — TestFlight coming soon.

## Built With

- SwiftUI
- AVFoundation
